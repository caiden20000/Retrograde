# Retrograde

Space trading game written in TS/React.  
Try it here: [Retrograde](https://caiden20000.github.io/Retrograde/)

### What

Retrograde is a small game where you travel to different stations and buy/sell goods to gain a profit.
Later on, there will be crew, missions, encounters, battles, factions, etc.  
This is a work in progress! If this were a real game, it would be pre-pre-alpha.

### Why

I'm making the game to get more familiar with React, and have a semi-long-term project I can work on.
This has been a learning experience, and I'm still learning every day.

## TODO

- System map
  - A price list that color-codes each station based on the value of the good selected.
- Shipyard
  - A place to buy upgraded ships with more capacity
- Equipment store
  - A place to acquire and equip equipment to ships, giving passive stat boosts.
  - Eventually also weapons here
- Crew
  - Hire people based on their skills for passive skill boosts
  - Experts grant unique abilities (TBD)

  - Gain money and reputation (TODO) in ways other than trading.
- Random encounters

### Design doc

I use Excalidraw to mock-up designs for the UI and other interactions.
