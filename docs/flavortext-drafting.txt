Flavortext is generated by taking random sentences, each pertaining to:
- Station type
- Station industry
- Station population size
- 2 random additional details

To ensure a good flavortext, there should be no material that would be contradictory if combined with another sentence from a different section.
The flavortext should be descriptive, reading mostly like an informative overview.
The first-person descriptive elements should mostly be saved for the additional details. There can still be first-person elements in the main 3 sections of flavortext, but keep it sensible.
The text shouldn't be too flowery or too descriptive, rather, it should be grounded and feel like a real description of a real place (in sci-fi context).
Additional details should be written as permanent, as they won't be regenerated if you visit the same station twice.
That means no "events", rather, additional details should be about the surroundings.

Factory:
With various kinds of large industrial machinery looming above the walkways, this station is made with production in mind.
This factory has many small company shops that sell various goods to the resident workers.
This factory is busy and loud. The smell of metallic dust fills the air, despite the air filters working at full capacity.

Refinery:
This refinery processes ore into various metals.
This station refines ore into high and low grade metal.
This refinery provides a steady flow of metal to nearby factories.

==============
Station industry

mining:
Here, local asteroids are mined for their precious ores.
A steady stream of mining ships flow into and out of the many cargo ports around the station.
Ore is mined from the local moon and brought here for further shipping to refineries.

refining:
Here, metals are made from the raw ores provided by the local mining industry.
At this station, ore is processed into large metal sheets.
A massive crucible of molten metal passes overhead, towards some unknown destination.

manufacturing:
Here, formless metal is turned into various components.
Fasteners, beams, casings, and more are produced from pressing and reflowing metals.
A bunch of little metal parts used in almost every product are produced here.

assembling:
Here, various parts and components are assembled into products.
The factory floor houses thousands of workers, both organic and robotic, working in unison to assemble many things.
Several local industries rely on this assembly factory to create products they need.

trading:
Here, many goods and services are traded.
Unlike more organized stations, this station is a patchwork of shops, utilities, restaurants, and housing bays.
There are too many little stores to count, and it's not really clear what most of them sell.

supplying:
Here, essential supplies like food and water are sold.
Here, there are only the essentials - food, water, and air.
Not enough people come here to support any business past the selling of essentials like food and water.


=============
Station population

Pop [1] 100-1000:
There aren't many workers around, and the place feels mostly empty.
There aren't enough workers to keep up with system maintenance, so robots fill in the gaps.
The station is small, but more than enough space for the current population.

Pop [2] 1000-10000:
The station map shows several residential bays, enough to house up to 10,000 people.
There are some people waiting around the ship bay, looking for work.
The station seems to be growing, gaining about a thousand residents every solar cycle.

Pop [3] 10000-100000:
This station is large enough to house 100,000 people.
The infrastructure required to house its population takes up a sizable portion of the station.

Pop [4] 100000-1000000:
The infrastructure required to support the population is an incredible sight to behold.
This station was built to support up to 1,000,000 people. At the time it seemed like overkill, but the population is approaching the limit surprisingly fast.
There are hundreds of people everywhere you look. You can't find a quiet corner in this station even if you tried.


=====================
Additional details

The bay you docked in is small, only enough space for a couple ships.
You can see pneumatic tubes lining the corners of the ceilings, items zipping through them.
Behind some glass you can see the inner workings of a fully-automated cargo port: hundreds of specialized robots working synchronously to load and unload autonomous vehicles.
Some of the floor panels are rusted, you can even see through some of them down to the nutrition bay below.
It seems like traffic is highly regulated here. The station has several docking bays, but the autonomous system only let you dock in this one.
The gravity field seems to be calibrated incorrectly, and it'll take a few minutes for you to get used to it.
You can see a wall terminal showing shipping stats from the last few cycles - mostly steady, but not booming.
You can feel a the floor vibrate every so often, probably from nearby generators.
The floors and walls are scratched up from years of heavy machinery and miscalibrated docking computers.
There's a standing info panel, but the touch interface only works on half the screen.
Across from the docking bay is a steep dropoff, giving a great view of the resedential bays.
One of the old holopanels loops an outdated orientation video on mute.
There's a light breeze from the ventilation - it smells faintly of ozone and something synthetic.
The intercom beeps every few minutes, but nobody seems to care.
The area just past the docking bay is surprisingly clean. 
There are anchor points in the floor used for zero-G maintenance. It seems like this station doesn't have a backup gravity field generator.
Cleaning droids sweep through every few minutes, keeping the floor spotless.
Despite everything looking newly manufactured and modern, the main screen above the docking bay exit is already broken.
There are soot marks on the floor radiating out from the docking port next to yours - a ship must have experienced rapid unintentional disassembly here.
The ceiling above the bay is blackened in places, probably from years of unregulated thruster activity.
Several wall panels are missing entirely, exposing insulation and bundles of dusty cabling.
The docking clamps here look newer than the rest of the equipment.
When your ship approached the docking bay, a nimble array of mechanical arms guided your ship to the appropriate spot.
There's an overhead display showing arrival and departure logs in real time.
Wall-mounted control panels show status indicators for bay pressure, magnetic clamps, and internal gravity.
There's a security checkpoint built into the wall, with scanner panels and a personnel station.
A map of the stationâ€™s immediate sector is printed onto a static display beside the exit.





===================
Event details (TBD)

You see two droids heading towards each other narrowly avoid a collision.
The thick black exhaust pouring out of the ship docked next to yours is making things hard to see.
The bay you docked in is almost entirely taken up by a massive cargo ship.
